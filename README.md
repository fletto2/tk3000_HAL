# tk3000_HAL
GAL replacement for a Brazilian Apple IIe clone called 'TK 3000 IIe'

Use GALasm to compile the PLD file, or burn the provided JED file onto a GAL16V8.

The only difference on this clone's logic equations is the fact that GR (pin 7) is reversed when compared to Apple's 342-0140-A HAL IC.
